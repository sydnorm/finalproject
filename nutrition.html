        <h1>top 5 pre-workout snacks</h1>
        <div class = certificates>
            <div class="cert-button one">
                <h2>banana with peanut butter</h2>
                <p>bananas provide quick-digesting carbohydrates to fuel your workout, while peanut butter offers healthy fats and a small amount of protein for sustained energy. the high glycemic index (gi) of bananas makes them an ideal pre-workout carb source, shown to improve exercise performance by maintaining blood glucose levels.</p>   </div>
            <div class="cert-button two">
                <h2>greek yogurt with berries</h2>
                <p>greek yogurt is rich in protein to support muscle repair, while berries provide antioxidants and quick-digesting carbs. antioxidants from berries can reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress and muscle soreness, enhancing recovery.</p>
                </div>
            <div class="cert-button three">
                <h2>oatmeal with honey</h2>
                <p>oatmeal is a complex carbohydrate that provides a steady energy release, and honey adds a quick sugar boost. studies show that low-gi foods like oatmeal improve endurance by sustaining blood glucose levels longer during exercise.</p> </div>
            <div class="cert-button three">
                <h2>rice cakes with almond butter</h2>
                <p>rice cakes are a light, low-fiber carb source, and almond butter adds healthy fats and a touch of protein for longer-lasting energy. combining carbs with a small amount of fat enhances glycogen storage pre-workout.</p> </div>
            <div class="cert-button three">
                <h2>hard-boiled egg and whole wheat toast</h2>
                <p>the toast provides carbs for energy, and the egg delivers protein to support muscle repair. a balance of carbs and protein before exercise improves endurance and reduces muscle damage.</p>             </div>

                        <p>start with a plan! choose a day to plan your meals for the week, and make a detailed grocery list based on your menu. focus on recipes with overlapping ingredients to save time and reduce waste. set aside a block of time to cook, chop, and portion your meals in advance. invest in quality, airtight containers to keep food fresh and organized. prep proteins (like chicken, tofu, or beans), cook grains (like rice or quinoa), and wash and chop veggies in bulk. store meals in the fridge or freezer with clear labels and dates. stick to simple recipes at first, and gradually experiment with variety. keeping your pantry stocked with essentials like spices, olive oil, and canned goods will make the process smoother. consistency is key—prep weekly to build a habit and set yourself up for success.</p>

                        <p>staying hydrated is key to performing at your best, whether in the gym or throughout your day. start your morning with a glass of water to kickstart hydration after a night's sleep. carry a reusable water bottle and sip consistently instead of waiting until you're thirsty. add a pinch of sea salt or an electrolyte tablet to your water to boost hydration during intense workouts. eat water-rich foods like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon to supplement your intake. set reminders on your phone to drink water regularly, and aim for at least half your body weight in ounces daily. staying hydrated fuels your muscles, boosts endurance, and keeps your mind sharp—hydrate like a pro! </p>
