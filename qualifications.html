        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>hi, i’m olivia dunmire, and i’m thrilled to be part of your fitness journey! i’m based in buies creek, nc. currently, i’m pursuing my bachelor’s degree in kinesiology at campbell university, with plans to continue my education at duke university to earn my doctor of physical therapy (dpt) degree.
            fitness has always been a huge part of my life. growing up playing sports gave me a foundation in movement and discipline, but it wasn’t until high school that i truly fell in love with working out. what started as a hobby quickly grew into a passion that shaped my career.
            i bring a diverse range of experience to the table, from one-on-one personal training to small group training, group fitness classes, and even coaching sports camps. each of these opportunities has deepened my understanding of how to tailor fitness programs to meet individual needs while keeping them fun and effective.
            in addition to personal training, i run an instagram page, @livsimplefitness, where i share nutrition tips, workouts, fitness advice, and wellness content to inspire others to live a balanced and healthy life. my approach is science-driven, but it’s always grounded in simplicity and practicality—fitness should fit into your life, not the other way around!
            whether you’re just starting your journey or aiming to push your limits, i’m here to guide and motivate you with personalized care and expert knowledge. together, we’ll create a plan to help you feel stronger, healthier, and more confident every step of the way!</p>
